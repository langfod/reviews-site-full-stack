It is scientific in the sense that Bernard de Fontenelle based his science on Descartes’ Vortex theory which was accepted at the time. This is well described in more detail by Paul Murdin in his contemporary introduction to the work. The story is of a conversation between a young teacher (the book’s author, Bernard de Fontenelle) and a titled lady (The Marquise). Fontenelle provides astronomical explanations of the universe over five nights trying to convince The Marquise that the moon, the planets and the stars are inhabited. The Marquise tends to question what she is being told by Fontenelle and then eventually agree with him. In modern terms, many of the discussion points made are ridiculous, but some sound impressive. The conclusion is that life is widely distributed in the Universe, which is still an accepted viewpoint. There are also prefaces by the English translator, Aphra Behn, who was one of the first English female professional writers and by the book’s author, Bernard de Fontenelle.\r\n"

						+ "Ballard headshotTerry Ballard, an academic systems librarian for more than 40 years, recently finished up an ambitious project: visiting, photographing, and writing about 50 of New York City’s special libraries. The resulting book, Fifty Specialty Libraries of New York City: From Botany to Magic, from Chandos Books, publishes today. LJ caught up with him shortly before the book’s launch in order to find out a little more about the process behind his odyssey—and what it was like to visit 50 libraries in less than a year.\r\n"

						+ "Fifty Specialty LibrariesWhat was it like, visiting 50 libraries in less than a year?\r\n"
						+ "\r\n"
						+ "The whole idea was [intended] to be an adventure because I was going to personally visit 50 different libraries and talk to the head librarian, or somebody in authority. Also, in every case but two I used public transportation, the exceptions being New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx and the Staten Island Museum.\r\n"
						+ "\r\n"
						+ "It was very tiring, as it turned out. When I dreamed this up [I thought], oh, 50 libraries, that’s a manageable number. But when you have to make appointments and figure out transportation and so on, it was very grueling. In fact, the week that I was supposed to do my most intense visiting I got completely sick and could barely visit three or four libraries. So I was running perpetually late. It was a very short timeframe—I got the contract in November [2014], right around Thanksgiving, and they wanted the book turned in by June 1 [2015]. I didn’t quite make it. The last draft was sent July 15.\r\n"
						+ "\r\n"
						+ "There were a few libraries I wanted to visit that I just never got to. I figure if this book catches on and people like it, there will be a second edition with 60 libraries.",
				LocalDate.of(2016, Month.FEBRUARY, 16),
				"Everyone knows about the New York Public Library and the two lions that guard it. Most New Yorkers,..., do not know that the city contains many dozens of libraries outside of that system... There is a library devoted to magic, a dog library run by the American Kennel Club, a German language library, a library devoted to the works of Carl Jung, and a few subscription libraries that are centuries old and still going. Most of them are in Manhattan, but there are wonderful surprises in the outer boroughs, and we looked at those too.",

						+ "William James Murray (born September 21, 1950) is an American actor, comedian, and writer. He first gained exposure on Saturday Night Live, a series of performances that earned him his first Emmy Award, and later starred in comedy films—including Meatballs (1979), Caddyshack (1980), Stripes (1981), Tootsie (1982), Ghostbusters (1984), Scrooged (1988), Ghostbusters II (1989), What About Bob? (1991), and Groundhog Day (1993). He also co-directed Quick Change (1990).\r\n"
						+ "\r\n"
						+ "Murray garnered additional critical acclaim later in his career, starring in Lost in Translation (2003), which earned him a Golden Globe and a BAFTA Award for Best Actor, as well as an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. He also received Golden Globe nominations for his roles in Ghostbusters, Rushmore (1998), Hyde Park on Hudson (2012), St. Vincent (2014), and the HBO miniseries Olive Kitteridge (2014), for which he later won his second Primetime Emmy Award.\r\n"
						+ "\r\n"
						+ "Murray received the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor in 2016. His comedy is known for its deadpan delivery. \r\n"
						+ "Murray is a partner with his brothers in Murray Bros. Caddy Shack, a restaurant located near St. Augustine, Florida. He resides in Charleston, South Carolina, where he is a very active community member.\r\n"
						+ "\r\n"
						+ "In 1978, Murray appeared in two at-bats for the Grays Harbor Loggers Minor League Baseball team, credited with one hit and a lifetime batting average of .500.\r\n"
						+ "\r\n"
						+ "He is a part-owner of the St. Paul Saints independent baseball team and occasionally travels to Saint Paul, Minnesota to watch the team's games. He also owns part of the Charleston RiverDogs, Hudson Valley Renegades, and the Brockton Rox. He has invested in a number of other minor league teams in the past, including the Utica Blue Sox, Fort Myers Miracle, Salt Lake Sting (APSL), Catskill Cougars and Salt Lake City Trappers. In 2012 he was inducted into the South Atlantic League Hall of Fame for his ownership and investment activities in the league.\r\n"
						+ "\r\n"
						+ "Being very detached from the Hollywood scene, Murray does not have an agent or manager and reportedly only fields offers for scripts and roles using a personal telephone number with a voice mailbox that he checks infrequently. This practice has the downside of sometimes preventing him from taking parts in films such as Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Monsters, Inc., The Squid and the Whale, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and Little Miss Sunshine. When asked about this practice, however, Murray seemed content with his inaccessibility, stating, \"It's not that hard. If you have a good script that's what gets you involved. People say they can't find me. Well, if you can write a good script, that's a lot harder than finding someone. I don't worry about it; it's not my problem.\"\r\n"
						+ "\r\n"
						+ "Murray's popularity has been such that (as of 2017) he holds an iconic status in U.S. popular culture. Murray's eccentric and irreverent style of comedy, both on-screen and in his personal life, has caused him to be seen as a folk hero to many making him a significant meme in various media including books and the internet. In 2016 he was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor by the Kennedy Center.",
